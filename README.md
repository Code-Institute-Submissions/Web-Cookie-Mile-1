# Mile-1

Milestone One Project

The aim of this project is to satisfy Code Institute requirements as well as to represent my future business as a software provider. It is my very first project, hence, there is a lot more to be desired and tweaked before there is a final push and call out to customers. 
I believe, I have created mobile first approach web site using HTM and CSS, the modules I got familiar with so far. Bootstrap, has been used to a big extend as well. Back-end functionality is not available for that project, so, from the links, only “learn more” will work, providing external window loading my Resume.
I am a junior accountant, and even though, having limited to work on the project, I have big ideas on how this will grow in the future!

UX

I have focused primarily on simplicity, emphasizing on the landing page with the logo and moto of my future brand. It look just way I wanted to look.

•	Balsamiq – has been used to create the wireframe for the project

•	W3Schools – I used for the icons embedded in the drop down

•	Finally, I want to thank Code Institute for having me in that great program
